<!-- # About Me -->
I'm currently a PhD student in [Prof. Angela Dai](https://www.3dunderstanding.org/team.html)'s 3D AI Lab at TU Munich. My research focuses on 3D reconstruction and scene understanding. In particular, I’m interested in incorporating semantic or geometric priors into 3D reconstruction.


Previously, I was a research assistant working with [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). I received MSc and BSc degrees in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), where I worked on 3D point cloud understanding and robotic grasping with [Prof. Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/).
