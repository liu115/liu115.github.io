## About Me
I’m currently a full-time research assistant working with [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) in the Vision Science Lab at National Tsing Hua University. Previously, I was a full-time research assistant working with [Prof. Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/) in the Communications and Multimedia Lab at National Taiwan University. I received B.S and M.S. degrees in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU). My research interests include computer vision, robot learning, and 3D scene understanding. *I’m currently looking for a Ph.D student position.*
